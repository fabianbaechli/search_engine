## About
This repo is me trying at implementing a search engine. I'm interested in NLP so I'd like to incorporate that aspect into the project.
I don't know yet if an NLP approach to the search engine problem is even valid or highly unpractical.

## TODO
- Importing a high amount of websites into a database [in progress]
- Deciding, which indexing method sounds practical and interesting (document term matrix maybe)
- Indexing the websites in the decided manner
- Try to match search queries to documents by their similarity. Or isn't that how this works? I don't know yet.
